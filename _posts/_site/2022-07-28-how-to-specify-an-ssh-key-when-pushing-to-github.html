<p>I came across this issue today when pushing to a new github account completely unrelated to anything you may be reading now. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> only wanted to use my default ssh key and thus my other github account.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key' git COMMAND
</code></pre></div></div>
